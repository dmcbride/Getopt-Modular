Revision history for Getopt-Modular

{{$NEXT}}
        + Add exception types.  Theoretically good for translatability
          (but you get to handle translations and catching everything).
        + Add valid_values option
        + getHelpWrap will use Text::WrapI18N if available, otherwise use
          Text::Wrap (core).
        + Allow callbacks for "current value" and "valid value" strings in
          getHelp and getHelpWrap
